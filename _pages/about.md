I am a Postdoctoral Prize Research Fellow at <a href="https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk">Nuffield College</a>, University of Oxford. I completed my PhD at the <a href="https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences">Department of Social and Political Sciences</a>, at the European University Institute in Florence (Italy).

In my dissertation <a href="https://cadmus.eui.eu/handle/1814/77443">"The power of language. The use, effect, and spread of gender-inclusive language"</a> (supervised by <a href="https://www.eui.eu/people?id=arnout-van-de-rijt">Arnout van de Rijt</a> and <a href="https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/klarita-gërxhani">Klarita Gërxhani</a>), I combine several empirical methods (quantitative text analysis, a digitial field experiment, qualitative interviews, and ego-centric network analysis) to explore the phenomenon of gender-inclusive language from a sociological perspective.
